  Execute ds9:

    singularity run ds9
    singularity run ds9_b skymap.fits -region onoff_on.reg -region onoff_off.reg


  Example apps:

    singularity apps ds9                 # list the apps in the container

    singularity run --app crab ds9       # run the "crab" app in container
    singularity run --app pillars ds9
    singularity run --app cassiopea ds9
    singularity help --app crab ds9      # read a description of single app

%apphelp cassiopea
  "This RGB composite image shows a beautiful X-ray view of Cassiopeia A
  (Cas A), a supernova remnant located in our Galaxy about 11,000 light years
  away. These are the remains of a massive star that exploded about 330 years
  ago, as measured in Earth's time frame. At the center of the image is a
  neutron star, an ultra-dense star created by the supernova."

  "In this RGB composite the low energy X-rays from Chandra are shown in red,
  mid range energy X-rays are shown in green and high energy X-rays are shown
  in blue."

%apphelp crab
  "The Crab Nebula is the remnant of a supernova explosion that was seen on
  Earth in 1054 AD. It is 6000 light years from Earth. At the center of the
  bright nebula is a rapidly spinning neutron star, or pulsar that emits pulses
  of radiation 30 times a second."

  "This RGB composite image is composed from data at three different
  wavelengths. Infared data from 2MASS displayed in red, X-Ray data from Chandra
  displayed in green, and optical data from DSS2 displayed  in blue."

%apphelp pillars
  "At the center of the Eagle Nebula, towers of dust and gas form the stunning
  feature known as the 'Pillars of Creation'."

  "Imaged by Hubble's WFPC2 camera, this RGB composite image is composed of
  lower frequency optical data in red, mid range frequency optical data in
  green, and higher frequency optical data in blue."
